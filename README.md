# 100DaysOfCoding
I don't know what I am doing
I'm still trying to figure this out. 
I've decided to learn how to code because it feels like there is a whole new exciting world out there that I can be a part of. I have the desire to learn new skills, new languages and even change my career. Learning to code gives me the opportunity to do all that in one wholesome experience. I don't expect it to be easy but I know it will be worth it.
